> _"These blogs would be a rough sketch of what goes in my mind when things take place out in the world. Being given this spiritual vision to see with faith and purpose beyond the material senses of the mundane life, I’m making a meagre effort to write it down for reflections and share them with friends and loved ones for their enjoyment only."_
